Project 1, increasing California's participation in the SAT/ACT for 2021

It is the finding of this report that the College Board should increase its marketing and advertising campaigns as directed toward the state of California, specifically aimed at increasing affinity from public and private school administrators and 8th, 9th, and 10th grade students


### Problem Statement

HireMattPaterson dot com has been hired by the College Board to make recommendations on increasing the paticipation rates for the students in a single state such as California, America's largest state.  We set out to find the best and least expensive way to increase this participation, and thus increase revenue.
